## Angular CLI

- makes angular code runnable on browser ( like converting to js )
- needs nodejs ( to run js ), npm

### Source code files

1. Files which convert ts code to js using angular cli:

- tsconfig.app.json
- tsconfig.json
- tsconfig.spec.json

2. main.ts -> first file to load up when app runs in browser
3. index.html -> main html file to be executed
4. angular.json -> angular cli code written
5. package.json -> have all the dependencies req for the project

### Componenets

@Component - is a decorator - to add extra metadata to this class

- selector - tells angular for which elements to look in html code
- templateurl - html code which is renedered for selector tag

Angular that actually instantiates the classes in the end. We never call **new SomeComponent()** anywhere in our code.

#### Standalone component

Standalone components are components that donâ€™t rely on Angular modules (NgModules) to be used. Instead, they can declare their dependencies independently, which allows them to be directly imported into other standalone components, directives, pipes, or applications.

To check whether project is standalone or ng module based: Check **main.ts** Bootstrapping

In a standalone Angular project, the root component is bootstrapped directly without a module:

```
import { bootstrapApplication } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { AppComponent } from './app/app.component';

bootstrapApplication(AppComponent)
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```

In an NgModule-based project, bootstrapping typically looks like this:

```
import { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';
import { AppModule } from './app/app.module';

platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```

SCSS over CSS:  
provides nested styling

### NGRX

package/library for state management

State - data used in the application  
Store - data store - data will be stored to be read by component  
Selector - components can read data from store using selector  
Actions - to perform change in data in store  
Reducer - picks up the actions, logic written to change the data in store, needs initial state of store
Effects - side effects, triggered on certain actions


$ - if they store observable
data is selected from store using .select


| async  
async pipe - which listens for change whenever an observable changes  
add data using reducer

reducer uses on function to , first argument is action to which it listens to, second argument fucntion which updates the state
when we dispatch an action, that is when
