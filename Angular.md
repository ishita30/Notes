## Angular CLI

- makes angular code runnable on browser ( like converting to js )
- needs nodejs ( to run js ), npm

### Source code files

1. Files which convert ts code to js using angular cli:

- tsconfig.app.json
- tsconfig.json
- tsconfig.spec.json

2. main.ts -> first file to load up when app runs in browser
3. index.html -> main html file to be executed
4. angular.json -> angular cli code written
5. package.json -> have all the dependencies req for the project

### Componenets

@Component - is a decorator - to add extra metadata to this class

- selector - tells angular for which elements to look in html code
- templateurl - html code which is renedered for selector tag

Angular that actually instantiates the classes in the end. We never call **new SomeComponent()** anywhere in our code.

#### Standalone component

Standalone components are components that donâ€™t rely on Angular modules (NgModules) to be used. Instead, they can declare their dependencies independently, which allows them to be directly imported into other standalone components, directives, pipes, or applications.
