## Angular CLI

- makes angular code runnable on browser ( like converting to js )
- needs nodejs ( to run js ), npm

### Source code files

1. Files which convert ts code to js using angular cli:

- tsconfig.app.json
- tsconfig.json
- tsconfig.spec.json

2. main.ts -> first file to load up when app runs in browser
3. index.html -> main html file to be executed
4. angular.json -> angular cli code written
5. package.json -> have all the dependencies req for the project
